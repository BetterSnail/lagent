## ‚ú® Introduction

#### Demo Video here

MindSearch is an open-source AI Search Engine Framework with Perplexity.ai Pro performance. You can simply deploy it with your own perplexity.ai style search engine with either close-source LLMs (GPT, Claude) or open-source LLMs (InternLM2.5-7b-chat). It owns following features:
- ü§î **Ask everything you want to know**: MindSearch is designed to solve any question in your life and use web knowledge.
- üìö **In-depth Knowledge Discovery**: MindSearch browses hundreds of web pages to answer your question, providing deeper and wider knowledge base answer.
- üîç **Detailed Solution Path**: MindSearch exposes all details, allowing users to check everything they want. This greatly improves the credibility of its final response as well as usability.
- üíª **Optimized UI Experimence**: Providing all kinds of interfaces for users, including React, Streamlit, Terminal. Choose any type based on your need.

## üëÄ How MindSearch Works

<img src="docs/imgs/mindsearch_framework.png">

MindSearch consists of a Web Planner and Web Searcher. WebPlanner models the complex problem-solving minds as a dynamic graph construction process: it decomposes the question into sub-queries as graph nodes and progressively extends the graph based on the search result from WebSearcher. Tasked with each sub-query, WebSearcher performs hierarchical information retrieval with search engines and collects valuable information for WebPlanner.
The multi-agent design of MindSearch dispatches a load of processing massive information to different agents, enabling the whole framework to process a much longer context.
